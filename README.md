1. What is the average number of victims among men and women in each state of the United States?

2. Does the status of the solved crime depend on the type of agency?

3. Does the choice of weapons depend on the race of the perpetrator?

4. Does the age of the victim and the age of the perpetrator differ significantly?

5. Are there similar US states based on the values of variables such as average of “perpetrator age”, average of “victim age” and average number of crimes?
